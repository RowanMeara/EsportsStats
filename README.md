# EsportsStats
Currently there are several websites that track the esports scene on Twitch and 
the health and viewership of various games. However, Youtube Gaming's 
viewership has increased significantly to the point where they are now too 
large too ignore.  EsportsStats was designed to fix that problem aggregating 
Twitch and Youtube viewership data in one place.  

I started this project because of the frequency of threads discussing LCS 
viewership without any concrete numbers.  Some insiders have said that 
esports as well as LCS viewership has not really risen in the last year yet 
now major sports teams are spending tens of millions of dollars on 
franchised spots for the Overwatch and League leagues.
